            <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
            <p>Universal Design (UD) is designing with the intent of the product being available to largest audience possible, reguardless of disability or circumstance. This means that the product should be accessible with ease and pleasure for all who wish to use it. UD is <em>not</em> returning to inaccessible designs and adding accessibility features; it is designing with accessibily embedding at the beginning of the proccess. This site focuses on UD for web design, however, UD can be applied to any field that involves design: interior design, civil engineering, etc.  </p>

            <h2>Why Universal Design?</h2>
            <p>Universal design is also <em>good</em> design. When products are designed with the intent of being accessible to disabled communities, intuitive tools arise that benefit an even wider audience. This is called the curb-cut effect. UD also makes good business-sense. Less resources will have to allocated if accessiblity is embedded from the beginning as opposed to changing a design to be accessible at the end of production. With UD, obstacles are removed before they become problems. Additionally, it is in the interests of mosts businesses to reach as wide and audience as possible, and UD helps to acomplish that. Most importantly, UD is kindness. It sends to message, "Whoever you are, you're welcome here."</p>
