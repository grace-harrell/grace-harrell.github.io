            <h2>The 7 Principles of Design</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 1: Equitable Use</h3>
                <p>The design is useful to people with a diverse range of abilities.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 2: Flexibility in Use</h3>
                <p>The design accommodates for individual preferences and abilies via different methods of use.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use</h3>
                <p>The design is easy to userstand, reguardless of prior experience and knowledge, or lack thereof.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 4: Perceptible Information</h3>
                <p>The design communicates important information effectively reguardless of the user's sensory abilities.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 5: Tolerance for Error</h3>
                <p>The design minimized hazards and consequces of unintended actions.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 6: Low Physical Effort</h3>
                <p>The design can be used efficiently without great effort or cause for fatigue.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</h3>
                <p>The design uses appropriate size and space for interactability reguardless of the user's mobility.</p>

            <h2>Norman's Concepts of Design</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Priniple 1: Visibility</h3>
                <p>The more visible an element is, the more likely a user is going to know about that element and how to use it. All of the interfaces functions, status, and content, should be obvious to the user.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Priniple 2: Feedback</h3>
                <p>Feedback involves sending back information to a user to indicate that an action has been taken. For example, a link turning from blue to purple after being visited.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 3: Constraints</h3>
                <p>Constraints limit the actions that are available for a user to take. This helps prevent the user from being overwhelmed and to make the next action that they should take clear.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 4: Mapping</h3>
                <p>This is about the relationship between controls and their effects in the world. There should always be some sort of indicator that a control is associated with an effect. A physical example of this would be a light switch places near a the light that it controls. A digital example of this would be a volume slider that increases volume when the slider is moved right and decreases it when the slider is moved left.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 5: Consistency</h3>
                <p>Interfaces should use patterns to create a uniform and predictable experience. Using consistent colors, typography, and iconography also helps to establish a brand identity.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Principle 6: Affordance</h3>
                <p>Affordance is similar to a clue that indicates how to interact with an item. For example, if there is a button that looks like it can be pressed, it becomes obvious to the user that they can press it. If an aspect of your design is interactable, it should have some attribute that indicates it.</p>
