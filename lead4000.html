            <h4>Bio</h4>
            <p>
              &emsp; My name is Grace Harrell, and I'm currently a senior at CU Boulder pursuing a
              BS in Computer Science. I'm passionate about researching the intersections of technology 
              and society and intiating dialouges surrounding them. Presently, I acomplish this through
              my Sci-Fi bookclub, ELLA, and my participation the the Engineering Leadership program at
              CU Boulder.

              <h4>My Leadership Philosophy</h4>
              <p>
                &emsp; There are those of us in the world who are uncomfortable sitting
                still. The wicked problems of the world leave us disturbed, 
                and the disquiet winds up into a ball of anxious energy. From here,
                there are a couple things we can do: we can shake our heads, sigh and say,
                "Well, that's a shame", or we can utilize that energy to take action. These actors strive to 
                do a little good in the world. I view a leader as a catalyst for actors. 
                A leader is a person who create pathways for others to take action and
                inspires them to make a change.
                <br>
                &emsp; How do these leaders reach an audience and spur them to act? This
                is the skill-set that the Leadership Studies program at CU Boulder has
                fostered in its students. First, the leader must be able to observe.
                By observing, they can identify existing wicked problems and groups of 
                people who have the capacity to be actors. Then, after research about root-causes,
                consultations with the effected, and immersing themselves in the issue, the leader must write
                the blueprints to solve it. This doesn't have to involve literally writing 
                a step-by-step guide to a full proof solution to the wicked problem. If solving
                wicked problems was that straight foward, we'd be rid of them all by now. By "writing
                the blueprints" I mean putting systems in place to counteract the wicked
                problem. This can entail organizing a group of actors, forming  connections
                with existing operations, or ideating and documenting ideas that can be
                used to fight the problem. The purpose of the blueprint is that it provides
                a map to combating the issue that anyone can follow. 
                <br>
                &emsp; Utimately, leaders must maintain the momentum. Keeping people engaged
                involves consistent communication, celebration of successes, and recalibration when challenges arrive.
                The mark of a leader is not just the vision they create, but the action they incite. Through
                observation, strategy, and inspiration, a leader fosters an environment where actors rise, and the
                collective impact is far greater than any individual effort.

              <h4>My Leadership Praxis</h4>
              <p>
                &emsp; There are two main facets through which I exemplify my leadership praxis. The first is
                my bookclub, ELLA, and the second is the project that I'm currently working on with NASA for my
                senior capstone in my Computer Science BS program.
                <br>
                &emsp; ELLA, or the Engineering Leadership and Literature Association, is a book club that I 
                cofounded and am currently president of. The idea for the club arose becuase I had identified
                a wicked problem; there was a severe lack of humanities education in the engineering department 
                at CU. I consider this to be a serious issue, because engineers have an incredible power
                to probelm solve, but so often don't realize how their skills can be applied outside of a 
                technical environment. Tech shapes the world around us, so it is essential to have
                an understanding of the world and how the tech we create will effect it. My goal with ELLA
                was to create an environment that fueled dialouges in which engineering students
                can consider the broder implications of their work. I've found that sci-fi books are a
                perfect vessel for this. The books we read involve technoliges that shape the character 
                interactions, conflicts, and settings of the book. These are books that the students are
                able to apply to their unique interests as well as expand the context that they think about
                their engineering studies. It is my job as a leader in the club to recruite students
                who I think would benefit from the club, starting discussions, and finding ways to maintain
                engagment. 
                <br>
                &emsp; The other leadership role I have is that of a project manager. In this role I have to
                coordinate teh team and deliberate tasks. Throughout my time in this role, I've realized 
                how important it is to keep the bigger picture in mind; we have a desired outcome for the 
                project, and I have to make sure that we've moving towards that. In order to do this, I have to 
                have a clear vision of our goals and the skill sets of my team mates. 
                <br>
                &emsp; In both ELLA and my NASA projectmy leadership revolves around fosftering collaboration, maintaining
                focus on the larger goals, and empowering others to contribute their unique skills.
